# Workplace Resources and Willingness to Speak Out  
## A Study of Mental Health in the Tech Industry

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes how workplace mental health resources influence employees’ willingness to discuss mental health concerns in the tech industry. The analysis is based on the **2014 Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI)** survey, a global non-profit initiative focused on improving mental wellness in tech communities.

Using Python-based data analysis and regression techniques, the study quantifies the relationship between organizational support structures and employee disclosure behavior.

- Measure the availability of mental health resources across tech workplaces  
- Analyze employee awareness of mental health care options  
- Quantify the relationship between workplace resources and willingness to speak openly  
- Provide data-backed insights relevant to NGOs, HR teams, and policy designers
